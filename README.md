# Final Fantasy 50

This was my final project for CSCI E-23a Introduction to Game Development.

## How to install

'Final Fantasy 50' was created using the Love2D framework.
Just install Love2D and follow the directions from their website on how to run the game!

https://love2d.org/

Note: Requires LOVE 0.10.2 (Super Toast), it will not work with the latest versions.

## Directions for how to play

In the overworld, press 'Enter/Return' or 'Space' to interact with people/objects.

In combat, press 'Enter/Return' or 'Space' to select an option and 'shift' to go back.

That's pretty much it, I hope you enjoy the game!
